# Genetic-Optimization-Algorithms-from-Scratch

In this project, I exprimented with the functionality of a various genetic algorithms on the following functions: Sphere, Bent Cigar, Rastrigins and Ackley.

# Designing a Basic Genetic Algorithm:
1. Each chromosome consists of 30 genes.
2. Each gene is a real valued number in a specified boundar.
3. Calculating the fitness of each chromose based on the value of our target function (Sphere, Bent Cigar, Rastrigins or Ackley).
4. Choosing parents based on the Roulette-wheel method.
